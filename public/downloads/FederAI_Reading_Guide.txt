Showcasing Federated Learning: Video Production & Website Development



1. Background

Project Summary

In this project, Desislava and I (Khoa) are working together on a Federated Learning showcase. We are developing both a short video and an informative website to explain what Federated Learning is and how students are using it in real-life projects. Our main stakeholders are Pu, Danny, and Marcel, who are part of the Art-IE research initiative from Fontys and Odisee. 
The project will result in:





A 2–3 minute engaging video that answers the question “What is Federated Learning?”



A functional website that contains visuals, learning content, student posters, use cases, and outcomes of FL projects

3. Process (Double Diamond)

Phase 1: Discover | April





Objective: Understand the context, user needs, and current gaps in how Federated Learning is explained, especially to non-experts.



Research Question: What are the best ways to communicate the concept of Federated Learning to a broad audience through video and a website?



Approach & Methods: Stakeholder interviews, benchmarking analysis, literature review



Tasks:





Stakeholder Interviews & Alignment @Interview Report FL (Team) - Reason: Talking with Pu, Danny, and Marcel helped us understand the goals and expectations for this project. It also gave us insight into the challenges they faced in explaining FL clearly and engagingly in past sessions.



Literature & Video Review (Desislava) - Reason: Looked at how Federated Learning is introduced in articles, videos, and public talks. This helped identify common explanations, visual tools, and simplification strategies that work well.



Literature Analysis: What is Federated Learning? @Literature Analysis FL (Khoa) - Reason: I analyzed documents and academic articles to deeply understand the foundations of Federated Learning and how it is communicated in various formats.



Results: We identified that most Federated Learning explanations online are either too technical or too abstract. There’s a clear need for a version that is visual, brief, and aligned with real use cases - especially student-driven projects. Stakeholders also emphasized the need to connect the video and website clearly, so they support each other.



Conclusion: To build a strong foundation, we must define a focused message that makes Federated Learning understandable for new audiences, and a structure that connects storytelling with student results.



Next Step: Move on to the Define phase to shape the script, structure, and key content for both the video and website.

Phase 2: Define | April





Objective: Clearly define the project scope, key content, and responsibilities to ensure the video and website support the communication goals effectively.



Research Question: What core content, structure, and roles are needed to present Federated Learning clearly and connect all materials across video and web?



Approach & Methods: Content planning, storyboarding, role assignment, and structural mapping



Tasks:





Benchmarking Educational Platforms @Benchmarking FL (Khoa) - Reason: I explored how other platforms (like Google’s AI hub or research project sites) explain technical topics to learners. This gave me useful inspiration for our own structure, visuals, and tone of voice.



Sketches @Sketches FL (Team) - Reason: We used rough sketches to visualize the video and website layout. This helped align our ideas and explore different visual directions before committing to production.



Task & Role Division (Team) - Reason: We decided to divide the work based on our strengths: Desislava focuses on video production, and I (Khoa) focus on web development. This way, we can work in parallel and stay efficient throughout the project. Results: We built a clear content outline and project plan. The video will focus on explaining Federated Learning in a simple, visual way. The website will showcase student projects and provide supporting materials. Our roles and workflow were also clarified, which allowed us to move forward with more focus.

Conclusion: By defining the scope, roles, and structure early on, we made sure that both the video and website stay aligned with our goals and are manageable within the time available.



Next Step: Move into the Develop phase by starting scriptwriting, prototyping, and early production work.

Phase 3: Develop | May





Objective: Build and test the first working versions of both the video and website to get early feedback and refine our ideas.



Research Question: How can we translate our content and structure into a clear, engaging prototype that communicates Federated Learning effectively?



Approach & Methods: Scriptwriting, visual design, prototyping, stakeholder feedback



Tasks:





Scriptwriting & Visual Planning (Desislava) - Reason: Desislava created the first version of the video script and selected the visual style (animations, icons, voice-over) that would match the tone we discussed in earlier phases. This helped turn abstract explanations into something more visual and audience-friendly.



Rough Video Cut (Desislava) - Reason: A first cut of the video was produced to test pacing, clarity, and engagement. This allowed us to show something concrete to stakeholders and check if our approach was on the right track.



Website Development | Initial version @Technical Report FL Initial (Khoa) - Reason: I designed the layout began building the front-end in HTML/CSS/JS. This gave us a working version of the website that stakeholders could click through and comment on.



Feedback Round: Mid-Review Meeting @Mid-Review Feedback Report FL (Team & Stakeholders) - Reason: We attended a feedback session to test both the video cut and website draft. Stakeholders gave us specific tips on tone, visual clarity, and how to better connect the website with the video content.



Name & Logo Design @Name and Logo Report FL (Team) - Reason: We explored different names and logos to brand the project. A good name helps make the platform more memorable and the logo supports visual identity.



Results: We created first drafts of both deliverables, identified areas to improve, and collected valuable input from our mentors and partners. This allowed us to adjust our direction before moving to final production.



Conclusion: Prototyping early helped us avoid last-minute changes and align our work with stakeholder expectations. It also gave us more confidence in our design and content choices.



Next Step: Finalize the deliverables in the Deliver phase—refine visuals, add missing content, and get ready for public presentation.

Phase 4: Deliver | June





Objective: Finalize all deliverables and prepare for the final presentation at Fontys Innovation Inside Day.

Poster @Poster FL (Team) - Reason: We designed a printed poster to visually summarize the project. This was displayed during the final presentation to provide a quick overview and attract interest from attendees.



Results: We delivered a polished and professional video and website that together explain Federated Learning and showcase the results of our student research. The project received positive feedback for clarity, design, and educational value.



Conclusion: This phase brought together all our work and allowed us to share it with a wider audience. Our deliverables now serve as a clear starting point for anyone interested in learning about Federated Learning.



Next Step: Collect final feedback, archive the materials, and reflect on personal and professional lessons learned during the project.

Sub-Research Questions – Answers:





What key messages and visuals best explain Federated Learning to general audiences?

Through benchmarking and literature analysis, we discovered that general audiences understand Federated Learning better when it is explained using everyday analogies, simplified terms, and visual metaphors. Concepts like "learning without sharing your data" or "collaborative training without central storage" were most effective. Diagrams showing local devices training individually and then combining results worked well, along with use-case examples like keyboard predictions or medical data protection.



How do we ensure the video is both educational and engaging?

From testing and stakeholder feedback, we learned that the video should be short (under 3 minutes), use a storytelling structure, and avoid heavy technical language. Animated illustrations, a clear narrator, and structured pacing (intro–problem–solution–impact) kept viewers engaged. Including student-driven cases and visual consistency also helped bridge clarity and interest.



What website structure supports both showcasing and learning?

Our research showed that separating sections by user goals (e.g., “What is Federated Learning?”, “Student Projects”, “Tools & Resources”) improved navigation. A clear homepage summary, scroll-based flow, and layered information (headlines first, then detailed blocks) allowed users to either explore deeply or get a quick overview. Visual hierarchy and consistent layout patterns also supported ease of learning.



What content (student posters, use cases, demos) needs to be integrated?

Stakeholder input and prototype testing confirmed the need to include real student work,, explanatory visuals, and relevant external resources. These elements create transparency, provide examples, and highlight how Federated Learning is used in practice. Grouping content by purpose (learn vs. explore vs. download) gave more structure and clarity.



How do we ensure the platform is accessible and works well technically?

Technical testing and user feedback led us to prioritize mobile responsiveness, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML structure. We ensured good contrast ratios, alternative text for images, and flexible layouts. The site was tested on different browsers and devices to confirm functionality. Accessibility features, while basic, created a foundation for a more inclusive user experience.



4. Conclusion

This project demonstrated how user-centered design and visual storytelling can simplify complex technical topics like Federated Learning. By following the Double Diamond method, we kept our process structured and purposeful - from understanding user needs to delivering clear and meaningful solutions. Weekly check-ins and continuous feedback from stakeholders ensured we stayed aligned and made informed decisions throughout.

Is the Problem Solved?
Yes, we successfully delivered two key outcomes that meet the needs of our target audience:





An introductory video that explains Federated Learning in simple terms using clear visuals - ideal for newcomers.



A companion website that dives deeper into the technical details, showcases student projects, and provides supporting materials for more advanced users.

Together, these outputs make Federated Learning more accessible and engaging for a wide range of users, from beginners to those with technical experience.

Future Improvements
To ensure the long-term value of this platform, we recommend the following next steps after the June 27 presentation:

With continued development, the platform has the potential to become a lasting educational tool that supports broader understanding and application of Federated Learning.



5. Reflection

Working on this project gave me a great opportunity to grow both as a designer and a team member. I learned how to explain complex topics, like Federated Learning, in a way that is clear and friendly to different types of users. Using the Double Diamond method helped me stay focused and break the work into clear steps - from understanding the problem to creating real solutions.

One of the biggest things I learned was the power of visual storytelling. I saw how using simple words and images can help people understand technical ideas more easily. This was especially important for the video, where we had to explain FL to people who may not have a technical background.

I also learned how to manage two different media - video and website - at the same time. It was a challenge to make sure both parts of the project worked well together, but it taught me a lot about planning and balancing tasks.

Getting weekly feedback from stakeholders helped me see what was working and what needed to improve. It reminded me how important it is to test ideas early and often. I also enjoyed working with my team and learning from their skills and perspectives.

Overall, this project made me more confident in my ability to take on real-world challenges. I now feel more prepared to design for both clarity and impact, especially when working on educational or technical topics. I’m proud of what we created, and I look forward to using what I’ve learned in future projects.

By the end of June, we delivered two professional outcomes: a short video that explains FL clearly, and a website that showcases student efforts and connects different materials in one place.

We are proud of how far we’ve come and excited to present the final results at the Innovation Inside Day!
